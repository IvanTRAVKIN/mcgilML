## Machine Learning Project ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡

### Project Overview
This project, developed in collaboration with Lou Verplancke and Victoria ThÃ©baut at McGill University, focuses on predicting housing prices in Boston using machine learning techniques.

### Key Features
- **Data Visualization:** Utilized seaborn and matplotlib for visualizing data distributions, missing values, and correlation matrices.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing data, identified and removed constant columns, and scaled features using `StandardScaler`.
- **Modeling:** Implemented linear regression and decision tree regression models to predict housing prices (`MEDV`).
- **Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using metrics like R-squared, mean squared error (MSE), and visualizations such as scatter plots and decision tree diagrams.

### Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
- **Tools:** Vscode, GitHub
